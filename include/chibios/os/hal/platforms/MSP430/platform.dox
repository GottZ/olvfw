 * @defgroup MSP430_PAL MSP430 PAL Support
 * @details The MSP430 PAL driver uses the PORT peripherals.
 *
 * @section msp430_pal_1 Supported HW resources
 * - PORT1 (where present).
 * - PORT2 (where present).
 * - PORT3 (where present).
 * - PORT4 (where present).
 * - PORT5 (where present).
 * - PORT6 (where present).
 * .
 * @section msp430_pal_2 MSP430 PAL driver implementation features
 * The PAL driver implementation fully supports the following hardware
 * capabilities:
 * - 8 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset/toggle functions because special MSP430 instruction set.
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * @section msp430_pal_3 Supported PAL setup modes
 * The MSP430 PAL driver supports the following I/O modes:
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_UNCONNECTED.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_INPUT.
 * - @p PAL_MODE_OUTPUT_PUSHPULL.
 * .
 * Any attempt to setup an invalid mode is ignored.
 *
 * @section msp430_pal_4 Suboptimal behavior
 * The MSP430 PORT is less than optimal in several areas, the limitations
 * should be taken in account while using the PAL driver:
 * - Bus/group writes is not atomic.
 * - Pad/group mode setup is not atomic.
