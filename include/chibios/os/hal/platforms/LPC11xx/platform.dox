 * @details The LPC11xx PAL driver uses the GPIO peripherals.
 *
 * @section lpc11xx_pal_1 Supported HW resources
 * - GPIO0.
 * - GPIO1.
 * - GPIO2.
 * - GPIO3.
 * .
 * @section lpc11xx_pal_2 LPC11xx PAL driver implementation features
 * - 12 bits wide ports.
 * - Atomic set/reset functions.
 * - Atomic set+reset function (atomic bus operations).
 * - Output latched regardless of the pad setting.
 * - Direct read of input pads regardless of the pad setting.
 * .
 * @section lpc11xx_pal_3 Supported PAL setup modes
 * - @p PAL_MODE_RESET.

 *
 * @section lpc11xx_pal_4 Suboptimal behavior
 * Some GPIO features are less than optimal:
 * - Pad/port toggling operations are not atomic.
 * - Pull-up and Pull-down resistors cannot be programmed through the PAL
 *   driver and must be programmed separately using the IOCON peripheral.
 * - Reading of the output latch for pads programmed as input is not possible,
 *   the input pin value is returned instead.

 * @details The LPC11xx Serial driver uses the UART peripheral in a

 * - Clock stop for reduced power usage when the driver is in stop state.
 * - Fully interrupt driven.
 * - Programmable priority level.

/**
 * @defgroup LPC11xx_SPI LPC11xx SPI Support
 * @details The SPI driver supports the LPC11xx SSP peripherals in an interrupt
 *          driven implementation.
 * @note    Being the SPI a fast peripheral, much care must be taken to
 *          not saturate the CPU bandwidth with an excessive IRQ rate. The
 *          maximum transfer bit rate is likely limited by the IRQ
 *          handling.
 *
 * @section lpc11xx_spi_1 Supported HW resources
 * - SSP0.
 * - SSP1 (where present).
 * .
 * @section lpc11xx_spi_2 LPC11xx SPI driver implementation features
 * - Clock stop for reduced power usage when the driver is in stop state.
 * - Each SSP can be independently enabled and programmed. Unused
 *   peripherals are left in low power mode.
 * - Fully interrupt driven.
 * - Programmable interrupt priority levels for each SSP.
